# A little bit about me and my programing story!

Hi, my name is Mateusz, but u can talk to me Matthew(that's an English equivalent of my Polish name).
I like to play games, my favorite is League of Legends. I got interested in writing code in about 2016. 
I joined to an additional lessons where teacher was showing me about a lot of things about IT.
Like special robots that I can program, making a 3d prints, greenscreen etc. But the programing was this
one which I loved to do. This teacher recommended me an online programing course of C++. I forgot about this course until
2020 when I decided to end this course and get some knowledge, also I bought a C++ book. Now it's 2021 and I am very interested
in IT and that's why I found this page. Hope that I will learn some more with that page!
